From a chord progression, provide all available substitutions with same harmonical functions

## Installation

Install requirements.txt depdencies first with:

```bash
# Add any virtualenv first

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

```python
python3 main.py
```

To enable the mode to be clearly detected, the chord progression provided must be diatonic.

Tonic can be specified manually as parameter (when progression doesn't start with degree 'I')

## Tests

Mode detection has been tested across multiple diatonic chords progressions.

For ambiguous chords progressions, first chords is considered as first degree (I)

```bash
pytest -vs
```
